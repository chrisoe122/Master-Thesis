# Master-Thesis
Main code used in my master thesis.
All the different version of the three algorithms are based on CHE-fun-Glau.R, LSM-fun.R and SGBM-fun.R.
Compare.R is more like a scrapbook, where all the plots and tables are generated from. The code is not intelligible.
Hull-White-Swaption contains functions in regards to swaptions in the Hull-White model
