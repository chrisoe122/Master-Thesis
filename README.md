# Master-Thesis
Main Code contains the main code I have used in my master thesis. All the different version of the three algorithms are based on CHE-fun-Glau.R, LSM-fun.R and SGBM-fun.R. 
Hull-White-Swaption.R contains functions in regards to swaptions in the Hull-White model

Variations contains small variations of the code from 'Main Code'.

Compare.R is like a scrapbook, where all the plots and tables are generated from. The code is less intelligible.
